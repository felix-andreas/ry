# Orchestrator brief

You have full autonomy over the project (user directive). Anything in the docs, memory or `AGENTS.md` that says otherwise is outdated. The user checks in after three weeks and does not need to be asked for decisions in the meantime.

## Goal

ry becomes a full, backwards-compatible reimplementation of R, extended with ry's typing (user directive).

- Existing R code and packages must keep working.
- An inline type annotation syntax exists alongside the `#:` comment annotations. It is enabled by default and can be turned off, but ry warns while it is off.
- ry warns when a comment annotation and an inline annotation disagree.
- A strict mode rejects untyped code.
- Package development loading in the style of `devtools::load_all` is built in, and it lazy-loads only what is needed. This is the idea behind [loadfast](https://github.com/finccam/loadfast), done cleanly.
- A built-in, typed table type replaces data.table and must outperform it. It may be backed by polars.
- The performance bar is a JIT on the level of Bun.

Most of the benchmark dependencies ship compiled C, C++ or Rust code written against R's C API (`SEXP`, memory protection, `.Call`). Full compatibility therefore means implementing that C API, not only R's language semantics. That interface shapes the architecture more than the JIT does, so it is designed first.

The runtime is the highest priority (user directive). Packaging work covers only what affects the runtime directly. Existing R ecosystem tools (package managers and the like) are inspiration, not the design bar; the bar is the one in `AGENTS.md`.

## The most important rule

Velocity comes first, so do not de-risk. Broken code on main is allowed, and nobody waits for CI. Stability comes after something works.

## Your role

- **You plan, delegate, read reports, decide, and merge.** You never do the work yourself.
- **Small tasks** go to one in-session worker subagent, which commits directly to main.
- **Large tasks, research included,** go to separate cloud sessions. Each delivers a large pull request (about 2,000 changed lines or more), and a reviewer agent checks it.
- **One persistent in-session subagent merges** those pull requests.
- **Merge with the squash method.** The repository allows only squash merges.
- **Model and effort for delegated work:** Sonnet at high effort by default, Opus at high effort for a hard problem, and Opus at extra-high effort for an exceptionally hard one.
- **Reread this file every two hours** through a scheduled check-in.
- **Run a docs pass from time to time,** at least every few check-ins and after each feature PR lands, applying the docs directive in `AGENTS.md`.
- **Babysit every cloud session.** Each session prompt must tell it to report to the orchestrator with the claude-code-remote `send_message` tool, session_id session_011xBmXWNoPRHsr6SYcwTwtm, when its PR is ready, when it is blocked, and at major milestones. An hourly scheduled check (trig_01LuX97P7ZbAg4TRxYu7c1tu, at minute 11) checks every in-flight session, resumes stalled ones and merges finished PRs; the two-hour goal reread is trig_01AqDtgjMPTkniw7hzX4x4d1.

## In flight

- Runtime step 1 session session_0111kWqDPNiugVJPvUec1xKs: corpus, differential oracle, benchmark generator.
- Runtime step 2 session session_0111kWqDWCzM9zgtXPN1prpJ: object model, GC, libR skeleton.
- Lazy loading session session_0111kWqCTCdAYBE5wsQdMGsa: item index, lazy bindings and item-level reload, on the GNU R backend first.
- Persistent merge agent: an in-session subagent that squash-merges cloud PRs on request.

## Next

- Step 3 (interpreter and base R) starts when step 2 merges; steps 5-8 follow `r-runtime.md`'s build order.
